***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SCRIPT TO RUN***
When attempting to run my script I would get an error when clicking the play button on the top right.
For the script to run the user needs to right click the file name from the folders on the
left, select open integrated terminal, and then type "Python3 main.py" into the terminal and hit enter.

***Description of code***
Lines 1 and 2 are importing the "os" and "csv" libraries. 

Line 4 is setting the os path to connect to the file to pull the data from. 

Lines 6 - 11 are setting the various integers, lists, and variables to be used throughout the code.

Lines 14 - 17 are opening the csv file so the computer can read it. Then the computer is skipping 
over the first row of information because this is just the column headers and not any actual data. Finally,
the for loop begins so the computer can run through all the rows of data in the csv file with the commands
to follow. 

Lines 19 - 22 are assigning date and profit_loss where to pull their information from in the csv file. 
Then profit_loss is added to total_net and total months is counting the amount of rows. 

Lines 23 - 25 is an if statement adding to the net_change which is then editing the change_list list.

Lines 27 - 29 is another if statement that finds the greatest increase in change and the date associated
to it. 

Lines 31 - 33 is my final if statement that does the same thing as the last one but for the greatest 
decrease. 

Line 35 is setting the previous_profit_loss to be the current line being worked on so it may continue 
through the for loop to the next line.

Line 37 is finding the average change of profit loss or gain for the entire csv file. 

Lines 39 - 45 are printing the results of the analysis in the terminal in the desired format. 

Line 47 is creating a path to the text file the analysis will be printed on. 

Line 49 is opening that text file.

Finally, lines 51 - 57 are formatting the results of the analysis to the desired text file in the desired
format.
