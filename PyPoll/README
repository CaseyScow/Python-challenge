***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SCRIPT TO RUN***
When attempting to run my script I would get an error when clicking the play button on the top right.
For the script to run the user needs to right click the file name from the folders on the
left, select open integrated terminal, and then type "Python3 main.py" into the terminal and hit enter.

***Description of code***
Lines 1 and 2 are importing the "os" and "csv" libraries.

Line 4 is setting the path to connect to the file to pull the data from.

Lines 6 - 9 establish variables, an integer, and a list that will be used in the code.

Lines 11 - 14 open the csv file so the computer can read it. Then the computer is skipping 
over the first row of information because this is just the column headers and not any actual data.
Finally, the for loop begins so the computer can run through all the rows of data in the csv file with the
commands to follow.

Lines 16 and 17 is having total_votes count all the rows (votes) and is assigning candidate where to pull its
information from in the csv file.

Lines 19 - 22 count the amount of candidates that appear in the csv file. 

Lines 24 - 27 print the first part of the results in the terminal in their desired format. Due to the
desired format of the results and the task at hand, it is required for the code to run this way instead of 
saving all the text commands for the end. 

Lines 29 - 31 is a for loop that identifies how many votes and the percentage for each candidate. The last 
line is printing the results in the terminal in the desired format for the assignment. 

Lines 33 - 35 is an if statement that determines the winner by popular vote. 

Lines 37- 39 print the remainder of the results in the desired format within the terminal. 

Line 41 is creating a path to the text file the analysis will be printed on.

Line 43 opens that text file.

Lines 45 - 48 are formatting the results of the analysis to the desired text file in the desired format.

Lines 50 - 52 is the same for loop from lines 29 - 31 except this time it is formatting the text for the
file the analysis is being printed too. 

Finally, lines 54 - 56 are printing the results for the analysis to the desired text file.
